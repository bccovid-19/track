        Thanks for your interest in supporting the BC COVID-19 3D Printing
        Group. Your support is very important to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Demand for our products is increasing daily as more health care
        professionals run out of traditional personal protective equipment. We
        are rising to the challenge, but we can move faster with your support,
        either via materials or financial contributions.
      </p>
      <h5>
        Materials
      </h5>
      <p>
        We are in urgent need of clear plastics that we can form our face
        shields from. If you are aware of a source for PET-G, Laminating Sheets,
        Report Covers, Overhead Transparencies, or similar materials that might
        be suitable, our logistics team would
        <a href="mailto:admin@bcc3d.ca">love to hear from you</a>. Please
        contact us directly with the supplier information.
      </p>
      <h5>
        Finances
      </h5>
      <!-- dynamically load donors list from here -->
      <!-- <p>
        We would like thank our direct financial contributors to the project:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>DONOR #1</li>
        <li>DONOR #2</li>
      </ul> -->
      <p>
        As we ramp into larger scale production to support our provincial and
        local health authorities, financial support is key as we are resource
        bound, particularly when it comes to purchasing raw materials, and the
        cost of delivery of our products.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every dollar counts, and we are grateful for any contribution you can
        allocate to our project. All funds received go directly toward
        production expenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you would like to donate directly to our project, you can reach us at
        <a href="mailto:donations@bcc3d.ca">donations@bcc3d.ca</a>. (Interac
        e-transfers are also accepted via this email address). If you'd prefer
        to support us via GoFundMe, you can find our page
